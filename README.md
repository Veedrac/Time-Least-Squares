This is a comparison of pure-Python, Numpy, SciPy and Cython implementations of least squares regression. Original implementations come from Reddit user rasbt ([/u/rasbt](http://www.reddit.com/user/rasbt)).

Largely this started as a way to prove a point, but it quickly evolved a pointlessly large timing "suite". I'm particularly fond of the terminal bar graphs module (`terminal_bars.py`).
